Traditional biometric systems have encountered significant setbacks due to various unavoidable factors, for example, wearing of face masks in face recognition-based biometrics and hygiene concerns in fingerprints-based biometrics. This paper proposes a novel lightweight cross-spectral vision transformer (CS-ViT) using dual biometric traits of only forehead and periocular portions of the face, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. The CS-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative spectral patterns. Each channel consists of a Phase-Only Correlation Cross-Spectral Attention (POC-CSA) that captures their individual as well as correlated patterns. The computation of cross-spectral attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against the resolution/intensity variations and illumination of the input images, assuming both biometric traits are from the same person. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed framework was successfully demonstrated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database having 350 subjects. The CS-ViT framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an outstanding classification accuracy of $98.8\%$ with the dual biometric traits.
