On-demand vibration mitigation in a mechanical system needs the suitable design of multiscale metastructures, involving complex unit cells. In this study, immersing in the world of patterns and examining the structural details of some interesting motifs are extracted from the mechanical metastructure perspective. Nine interlaced metastructures are fabricated using additive manufacturing, and corresponding vibration characteristics are studied experimentally and numerically. Further, the band-gap modulation with metallic inserts in the honeycomb interlaced metastructures is also studied. AI-driven inverse design of such complex metastructures with a desired vibration mitigation profile can pave the way for addressing engineering challenges in high-precision manufacturing. The current inverse design methodologies are limited to designing simple periodic structures based on limited variants of unit cells. Therefore, a novel forward analysis model with multi-head FEM-inspired spatial attention (FSA) is proposed to learn the complex geometry of the metastructures and predict corresponding transmissibility. Subsequently, a multiscale Gaussian self-attention (MGSA) based inverse design model with Gaussian function for 1D spectrum position encoding is developed to produce a suitable metastructure for the desired vibration transmittance. The proposed AI framework demonstrated outstanding performance corresponding to the expected locally resonant bandgaps in a targeted frequency range.
